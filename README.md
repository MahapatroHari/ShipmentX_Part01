## Introduction

This repository includes solutions for three tasks, each demonstrating different front-end development skills. The tasks focus on creating a well-structured semantic HTML page, a responsive pricing table, and a basic interactive to-do list application. Below, you'll find detailed instructions on how to run each project and additional notes that may help you understand the code structure and logic.

## Task 1: Semantic HTML Structure

### Instructions
**Objective:**  
Create a simple webpage that demonstrates the use of semantic HTML elements to structure content properly.

**Requirements:**
1. **Header Section:**
   - Include a header that contains a logo, a navigation menu, and a tagline.
   - The navigation should consist of links to various sections of the website (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact).
   - Use appropriate semantic elements for the header and navigation.

2. **Main Content Section:**
   - Structure the main content to include an article with a title, text, images, and any additional relevant content.
   - Ensure that headings within the article reflect a logical hierarchy.
   - Incorporate a separate section within the main content that describes services or offerings.
   - Provide actionable elements like buttons for user interaction, distinguishing between navigation links and action buttons.

3. **Footer Section:**
   - Include a footer with contact information, social media links, and any other relevant information.
   - Use lists to organize links and ensure all interactive elements are semantically correct.

**CSS Requirements:**
- Apply basic styling to ensure clarity and readability.
- Focus on proper structure and maintainability rather than complex design.

**Additional Instructions:**
- Use dummy content (placeholder text and images) for all sections.

### Running the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `task-1` folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the project.

## Task 2: Responsive Pricing Table

### Instructions
**Objective:**  
Create a responsive pricing table with three different pricing plans (e.g., Basic, Standard, and Premium).

**Requirements:**
1. **Pricing Plan Headers:**  
   - Each plan should have a title, a short description, and a price.
   
2. **Features List:**  
   - List at least five features for each plan, with varying features for different plans.

3. **Call-to-Action Button:**  
   - Include a "Sign Up" or "Buy Now" button for each plan.

4. **Responsive Design:**  
   - Ensure the pricing table is fully responsive, meaning it looks good and functions well on both large and small screens.

**CSS Requirements:**
1. Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout.
2. Implement hover effects on buttons.
3. Highlight the most popular plan using different styling.
4. Include media queries for mobile responsiveness.
5. Feel free to showcase your creativity in designing the pricing table. You may experiment with colors, typography, and layout as long as the core requirements are met.

**Additional Instructions:**
- Use dummy content (placeholder text and images) for all descriptions, prices, and features.

### Running the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `task-2` folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the project.

## Task 3: Basic To-Do List Application

### Instructions
**Objective:**  
Create a simple interactive to-do list application using vanilla JavaScript.

**Requirements:**
1. **User Interface:**
   - Create an HTML file that includes:
     - An input field for the user to enter new tasks.
     - A button to add the task to the list.
     - A section to display the list of tasks.
   - Each task should include:
     - The task text.
     - A checkbox to mark the task as complete.
     - A button to delete the task.

2. **Functionality:**  
   - When the user enters a task and clicks the "Add" button:
     - The task should be added to the list.
     - The input field should clear after adding the task.
   - When a task is marked as complete using the checkbox:
     - The task text should visually change to indicate it is completed.
   - When the delete button is clicked for a task:
     - The task should be removed from the list.

**Additional Instructions:**
- Use clear variable names and include comments to explain key sections of the code.
- Focus on writing clean, maintainable code.
- Ensure the application is user-friendly.
